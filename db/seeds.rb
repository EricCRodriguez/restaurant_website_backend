# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Item.create(name: "Taco", ingredients: "steak" "tortilla", price: "$3")
Item.create(name: "Torta", ingredients: "bread" "steak", price: "$5")
Item.create(name: "Horchata", ingredients: "Rice Water", price: "$2")
